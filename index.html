      <h2 id="feet-graf">Massage Grandma's Feet</h2>
      <h3>"What? Eww!"</h3>
      <p>The title is self-explanatory. My earliest memory of making a buck is the 25&cent; my grandmother paid me 
         to lotion and massage her feet. I was older than five but younger than 10. Back then, my grandma lived in 
         the mountains a couple hours outside Denver, managing a little crossroad convenience store she stocked with 
         snacks, beer, bait and tackle--plus a few shelves of tchotchke she picked up at garage sales in the city. 
         Long days behind the counter meant nights of tired, sore feet for an old woman, and when we visited--after 
         helping in the store--I saw no reason not to put a little extra change in my pocket. </p>

      <h3>AKA The 12-year-old Hustle</h3>
      <p>It still surprises me, but I started my first true, paying job when I was 12 years old. 
         It's surprising not only because I was allowed to perform labor in the 7th Grade, but surprising further
         for the nature of the job: essentially a child, wandering the stairways and concrete halls of an American 
         football stadium jam-packed with more than 90,000 people. I carried my styrofoam box of hot, "crisp," meat burritos,
         waiting for drunk adults to make eye contact and point at me. I was too shy to holler out my wares, and anyhow 
         it's unlikely my voice could've met the din. There's more story here than I'm interested in chewing on,
         but given high level of alcohol consumption, stories do indeed abound.</p>

      <h3>Or A First Taste of Anarchy</h3>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">A few weeks into my job at the grocery store I was pushing a dry mop through the isles when I discovered an
         assortment of plastic pellets rolling out before me and collecting in the mop fibers. At the time, I 
         figured a customer had torn open a bag of Sixlets, and I didn't think much of it. Only thing was that 
         the pellets continued to appear in my mop each week thereafter. When I had seen it consistently enough, 
         I asked another of the grocery boys my age if he'd noticed them too. This is when I learned Mike, 
         our hardware manager, had stocked his section with a small supply of Airsoft rifles, and that on nights 
         when it was his turn to close the store, he'd decided to open a few because of "damaged packaging." Mike,
         role model that he was, proceeded to distribute the Airsoft rifles among the closing stock boys and, late 
         in the closing hours of the night, wage full-on warfare. 
         </p>
         <p class="funParagraph">I'll start and end with this anecdote and all its implications, because it remains among the most outrageous 
         of those three years.  Somehow, it has competition, but I'll let this example stand in for a vast array of other 
         decision making I witnessed.
